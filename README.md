### Hi, there 👋

I'm an undergraduate student at [UFRGS](http://ufrgs.br), scolarship at [Apple Developer Academy](http://www.bepid.com.br/poa/) and researcher. I love how new ideas come to life through technology and how that ideas could change our lives. I'm currently working on an analysis of movies that use the Hero Journey structure.

### Achievements 🏆

### It's dangerous to go alone! ⚠️

I believe that collaboration it's the main objective of @GitHub, so...

if you have any questions or just wanna talk you can create an [issue](https://github.com/jobedylbas/jobedylbas/issues/new).

Also you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jobedylbas/).
